Data Analytics
--------------

Hello, I am Victor Barradas, a passionate and dedicated computer engineer who has embarked on an exciting journey in the world of programming. My academic roots were established at the Faculdade de Informática e Administração Paulista – FIAP, where I dove deep into the realms of computer engineering, specializing in areas like artificial intelligence and computational intelligence. My career in programming took a significant leap during my internship at FIAP. Here, I honed my skills in technical computer support and IT infrastructure management, working from 7 PM to 11:15 PM, which taught me the value of dedication and hard work. This role, while not directly related to coding, provided me with a strong technical foundation and an understanding of the practical applications of technology in educational environments. My true passion lies in the field of Machine Learning and Python programming. Throughout my journey, I have been actively involved in developing my skills in Big Data analysis and ML algorithms. I have managed to balance my academic pursuits with practical experience, contributing to an embryonic startup that utilized AI for mineral prospecting. This project not only allowed me to apply my theoretical knowledge but also gave me firsthand experience in the challenging yet rewarding world of tech startups. I am always eager to push the boundaries of my knowledge and skills. Despite being relatively new to the professional world of data science, my enthusiasm and commitment have led me to work on various projects that leverage Machine Learning for data analysis and problem-solving. My GitHub repository (https://github.com/darthVarada) stands as a testament to my continuous learning and contribution to the field. As I move forward, I am excited to explore new opportunities that will challenge me and further expand my horizons in the ever-evolving world of programming and data science.
